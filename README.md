# borkboard

This is a program that lets you play a sound byte of gabe the dog barking as a piano. See [Know Your Meme](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gabe-the-dog-bork-remixes) for more information about how gabe the dog is used to make covers of songs. I wrote this for the entertainment of my friends and I, but also learned a bit about the physics of sound and tuning in the process (unfortunately this piano only has equal temperament).

Keyboard A-K can be played as a piano. Piano sounds are gabe the dog barking. Black keys are where you would expect, lshift and lctrl switch octaves.
